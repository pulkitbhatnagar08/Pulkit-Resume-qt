# Pulkit-Resume-qt

This contains documents of my assignment for IIT Bombay internship.

This is to inform you that I have tried to use QT Creator Software for the first time and learnt how to make different applications. 

I have tried to add the functionality of Bold/Unbold the text of the document and uploaded my Resume also.

I am facing trouble in subscript and superscript. I also didn't have ubuntu so using OCROpenCorrect is not possible in my configuration.

But, I know the solution to these problems. I know how an OCR works and regarding Sanskrit Text recognition Project, I have some ideas.
